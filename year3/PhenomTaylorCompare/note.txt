Hello linux wanderer. It is I, Michael Camilo, the last person to work on the
NS EoS project as of Spring 2024. For most of my last/third year of undergrad
research, I used this directory (hopefully still called PhenomTaylorCompare) to
make BF and constraint comparison plots. 

In the beginning of May 2024, I saved all my files (plots and large datasets) 
in my home computer. As to not have to update that tarred file due to me adding
new plots and datasets, I began my final work in a new directory (probably 
called lastStretch).
